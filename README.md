* LSTM Stock Predictor Using Fear and Greed Index
The index was good to capture big variations but not their intensity of up and down. Also showing a lower overall value.
It was the best to antecipate big up movents
Higherst error
the lower the window the better the result in term of error

* LSTM Stock Predictor Using Closing Prices (The best option for preditions)
The index was good to map the market variations but with a lower value and delayed response
Lowest error
the lower the window the better the result in terms of error
